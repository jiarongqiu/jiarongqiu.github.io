### Plateau at the Beginning of Training
  This is often due to bad configuration of hyper parameters or bad initialization of weights:
  * Case I: tuning the learning rate. Large learning rate often cause optimization unstable. Small learning rate may result in learning procedure get stuck.
  * Case II: if use default random uniform initializier for word embedding, it need at least 20 epochs for traning loss to decrease. Yet, using a truncated uniformed initializer with a std of 1e-2, the loss can decrease right at the beginning.
